Core code base for common functionalities

## Installing

```shell
pip install impfic-core
```

## Usage

To use utilities for external resources such as the RBN, you need to point to your copy of those resources 
in the settings (`settings.py`). Once you have done that, you can use them with:

```python
from settings import rbn_file
from impfic_core.resources.rbn import RBN

rbn = RBN(rbn_file)

rbn.has_term('aanbiddelijk') # returns True
```
